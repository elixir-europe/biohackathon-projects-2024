# Project 10: BioSchemas for mortals

## Abstract

Bioschemas is a community effort to improve the FAIRness of web-based resources.Established by ELIXIR over 7 years ago, it has good adoption by the technical communities in workflows, software and tools but less adoption than there should. Particularly in less technical communities such as training or even data services.

The Bioschemas website hosts tooling, training and guidance materials. Practical 'how to use Bioschemas' help and examples has been neglected. Guidance is technical - written by techies for techies - inappropriate or inaccessible for a large cohort of potential Bioschemas users. Examples focus on simple use cases and not real set-ups that users actually encounter in their work. This makes access to directly usable markup impossible, leaving users confused about where to go next. This lack of helpful support poses an unacceptably high technical barrier for the broader user community, and means we are not fully exploiting Bioschemas. Common complaints frequently cite a technical ‘barrier’, the lack of ‘lightweight’ guidance, the need to ‘demystify’ and lack of assistance to users who have the desire to implement bioschemas, but not the ‘how’.

The goal of this project is to reimagine, reframe and supplement the existing Bioschemas guidance available. Working with non-technical users from the data and training platforms,Patterns of use, tasks(different CMS; properties) andUser personas . This will be used toprovide users withspecific code examples that can be copy/pasted, documented examples for different web setups, customised guidance for different personas and be validated by non-technical users in the data and training platforms.
