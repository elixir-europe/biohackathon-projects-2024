# Project 29: ELIXIR FAIR Lesson Plan Handbook: advancing researchers’ & data stewards’ FAIR skills

## Abstract

Community activities (e.g., FAIRsFAIR, CONVERGE, ELIXIR-NL’s FAIR Data Day) have signalled the need for a framework onhow to teach FAIR skills to researchers and data stewards. Via hackathons (e.g., CONVERGE, BioHackathon 2023) with over 50 participants in total, a minimal viable product (MVP)[ELIXIR FAIR Lesson Plan Handbook](https://elixir-europe-training.github.io/ELIXIR-TrP-FAIR-Converge/) was created. Although lesson plans aren’t ready-to-go courses yet, they offer the basic framework for FAIR training. What do researchers and data stewards have to be skilled in to apply FAIR to datasets?

We propose a BioHackathon 2024 project for two reasons:

 * To improve the user-friendliness. At BioHackathon 2023, a new format was applied to some lesson plans. This was received well, and we will apply it to other lesson plans as well.
   
 * Align with developments in ELIXIR training:

    * [Learning paths](https://elixir-europe.org/focus-groups/learning-paths)for data stewards and researchers, as part of the new Learning Path FG. Providing users with a “pathway” to connect lesson plans so that it caters their needs, makes teaching FAIR more trainee-oriented. Many organisations struggle with training on how to go/do FAIR.
     
    * [TheFAIR Metroline](https://zenodo.org/records/10850958)(in development), an ELIXIR-NL initiative for a unified FAIRification workflow, based on a comparison of FAIR models. The FAIR Metroline smartly combines practical FAIR steps with training needs/gaining competences in organisations.
      
BioHackathon 2023 resulted in the creation of the GitHub repository, with corresponding website, for theELIXIR FAIR Lesson Plans. It will be BioHackathon 2024 that enables trainers to start using it, as we will work hard to restructure the content and engage with the community.
