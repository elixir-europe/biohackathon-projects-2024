## Abstract

The integration of life science data from different biomedical resources has been a major challenge attributed to fragmented data sources, the use of multiple data formats, and the existence of multiple ontologies for a single context among others. To address this problem, we launched the BioDataFuse (BDF) project, which employs a modular framework for integrating data from different sources into context-specific knowledge graphs. Through this project, we have currently been able to integrate and harmonise data from ten databases. However, the integration of such resources requires a detailed understanding of underlying graph schemas. 

In this biohackathon, we would like to streamline the data integration process such that any FAIR-compliant biological database can be easily converted to a graph. This robust process would involve two steps: first, understanding of the underlying graph schemas of data resources using the RDF-config (https://github.com/dbcls/rdf-config/) and VoID generator (https://github.com/JervenBolleman/void-generator) and second, the conversion of graph data into multiple compatible formats for improving accessibility and usability using G2G Mapper (https://g2gml.readthedocs.io/), LinkML (https://linkml.io/) and BDF (https://github.com/BioDataFuse/pyBiodatafuse). Moreover, we would test the resilience of the process by demonstrating the ease-of-integration of multiple data sources within the RDF Portal (https://rdfportal.org) and beyond. Through this test, we would essentially attract database owners to include additional biomedical data sources in BDF, thus expanding the applicability of their resource beyond the “yet-another-resource” paradigm.

## Working ethics

* :balance_scale: The use of GitHub issues and pull requests will be done to ensure the efficient working of multiple people on the GitHub repository.
* :no_entry_sign: No commits to be made directly to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository.
* :gear: Adding new Python functions should inherently involve writing subsequent unit test functions and documentation for the same.
* :handshake: The main aim of the hackathon is collaboration, so please feel free to ask questions or provide feedback whenever in doubt. `We believe that there are no dumb questions that exist.`
* :calendar: To ensure good communication among the team members, we would have two daily stand-ups (pre and post-hacking) allowing all participants to provide a less than 1-minute update on work done and work in the pipeline.
