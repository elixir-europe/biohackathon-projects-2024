# Project 2: A curated assessment of metadata descriptors of AI-ready datasets

## Abstract

To advance the use of Machine Learning for the understanding of diseases and conservation of biodiversity is important to promote FAIR AI-ready datasets since data scientists and bioinformaticians spend 80% of their time in data finding and preparation. Metadata descriptors for datasets are pivotal for the creation of Machine Learning Models as they facilitate the definition of strategies for data discovery, feature selection, data cleaning and data pre-processing. 

Once a dataset is AI-ready, such metadata descriptors change wrt the initial version of the raw data. What can we learn from the metadata of raw vs AI-ready datasets? What transformations from raw to AI-ready could be (semi)automated based on metadata descriptors? In this project, we will manually analyze and curate metadata descriptors before and after AI-readiness. Based on our analysis, we will identify dataset transformations that could be (semi)automated by software pipelines with the aim of alleviating the effort and time invested in data pre-processing for Machine Learning. 

The results will be later integrated into a metadata-based reproducibility assessment cycle, part of the NFDI4DataScience project in Germany. To facilitate the work during the BioHackathon, we will focus on datasets from the DOME registry as this would indicate already some level of availability for the metadata (even if hidden in a scholarly article).The AI-ready metadata descriptors will use the Croissant schema proposed by the ML Commons. This project will also take into account previous work done at the BioHackathon 2022 on metadata for synthetic data.
