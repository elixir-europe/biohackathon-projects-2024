# Project 24: Increasing FAIRness of digital agrosystem resources by extending Bioschemas

## Abstract

Research Data Infrastructures (RDIs) provide crucial publication services for researchers in the agrosystem domain. Due to their heterogeneous user communities and requirements, metadata standardization approaches to increase the FAIRness of resources can be a catalyst in simplifying data reusability and enabling cross-domain research.

One way for RDIs to increase the Findability of their resources is to provide metadata markup via Schema.org, a vocabulary consumed by well-known search engines. Bioschemas, an extension of schema.org focussed on the life sciences, is an open community effort, aiming at increasing the adoption of key metadata properties in a domain-targeted manner, through the creation of needed domain-associated types, agreed properties and usable metadata profiles for describing those life science resources. The project will work on developing new resources (types, properties, profiles) for Bioschemas, which will help to describe agrosystem datasets in a FAIR manner.

Participants will work on different topics, ranging from evaluating the current state of developed types and properties relevant to agrosystem resources to drafting new ones following use-case requirements and using example datasets. For increasing the metadata quality and supporting RDIs and their users in adopting the extension, participants will link properties to domain ontologies and facilitate mappings to other metadata standards, bolstering interoperability while following mapping frameworks like FAIR-IMPACT’s approach. To further ease the adoption for RDIs, participants will work on creating guidance and best practice documents on how to implement the extension into existing metadata description processes.
